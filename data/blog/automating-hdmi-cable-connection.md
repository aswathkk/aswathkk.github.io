I usually connect an external display to my laptop. Since I do not have an inverter at my home, whenever the electricity goes off, I cannot use my external display. In that case, I cannot view the windows that are there on the external display. In order for those to be visible on the laptop's screen, I have to disconnect the HDMI cable from my laptop.

Usually there won't be much of power outages in my area. Even if it is there, it will come back with in a few minutes. In those instances, rather than disconnecting the HDMI cable, I prefer to take rest till electricity come back. If I was working on anything interesting, I would disconnect the HDMI and work in my laptop.

But, recently due to heavy rainfall, the frequency of power outages increased in my area. So, either I have to take complete rest or I have to keep on connecting and disconnecting the HDMI cable. I cannot opt for the first option because I have to pay my bills üòú. So, I started searching for ways to reduce the effort of doing the second option.

## Xrandr command line utility

I came across a tool called [xrandr](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Xrandr) which can be used to set the size, orientation or reflection of the outputs for a screen. I found that this tool can also be used to disable and enable the displays. That's what I wanted.

Running `xrandr` without any arguments will show the current state of all the display devices. Here's the output of `xrandr` command:

```bash

```

This shows that we've two output display devices named **eDP-1** (laptop's screen) and **HDMI-1** (external display). Also it shows other information such as the available resolutions and currently active resolution etc.

We can disable any output by making use of `--off` flag. For example, if I wanted to disable HDMI-1 output:

```bash
xrandr --output HDMI-1 --off
```

To enable the output, we can make use of `--auto` flag. To make one display as the primary display, we can make use of `--primary` flag. If I wanted to enable both displays and make the external display as the primary one, I can make use of the following command:

```bash
xrandr \
	--output HDMI-1 --primary --auto \
	--output eDP-1 --auto
```

Yes. You can configure multiple displays in a single command.

My use case was to toggle HDMI display. That involves checking whether the display is already disabled or not.

## Checking if the display is disabled or not

I searched a lot and couldn't find a way to do this. Then, while looking at the `xrandr` output, I found that for the enabled output, it will show the resolution along with the 'connected' information. ex:

```bash
eDP-1 connected 1366x768+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 309mm x 173mm
```

To check whether HDMI-1 is enabled, I can make use of `grep` to do some pattern matching.

```bash
xrandr | grep "HDMI-1 connected" | grep -Pq "\\dx\\d";
```

## Final script to toggle HDMI connection

```bash
#!/bin/sh

if xrandr | grep "HDMI-1 connected" | grep -Pq "\\dx\\d"; then
    xrandr \
        --output eDP-1 --auto --primary \
        --output HDMI-1 --off
else
    xrandr \
        --output HDMI-1 --primary --auto \
        --output eDP-1 --auto --right-of HDMI-1
fi
```

I saved this script in a location and using the keyboard shortcut manager I created a keyboard shortcut (`Mod`+`0`) to call this script.

Now, whenever the power goes or comes, instead of physically disconnecting or connecting HDMI cable, I just need to press `Mod` (windows key) + `0` ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
