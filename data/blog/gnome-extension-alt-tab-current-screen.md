I connect an external display to my laptop and makes the external display as the primary display. In the laptop screen, I usually keep only Slack or any other messaging applications. And I also make use of multiple workspaces in the primary display. When I use Alt+Tab to switch between windows in the current workspace, Slack also pops up in the list of tabs that I can switch to. This is annoying because, most of the times I may need to keep pressing Tab to get the window that I wanted.

So, I started searching for some solution and I found [this](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1437/current-screen-only-for-alternate-tab/) Gnome Shell Extension. This will allow us to restrict the windows to be switched to only the the windows present in the current screen.

Here's the project's repository:
