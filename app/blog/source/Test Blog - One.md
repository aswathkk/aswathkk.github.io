Hi There,
Testing out a blog

Following is some markdown syntax

# Header 1

## Header 2

```javascript
// Testing out JS syntaxed code block
const a = 100;
console.log(a);
```

> Here's a blockquote

In the middle of text, trying to insert `code block` to see how it looks in my blog

---

Something else!

And here's a link to a website: [My Blog](https://aswathkk.github.io)
